### Simple Spreadsheet Analysis

The marketing ops team sent over this spreadsheet containing four years of data from a CRM system (please make a copy of the spreadsheet in order to manipulate the data):

The team wants to find the month they're likely to contact the most clients, so they can schedule a product upgrade announcement. Which month does the team tend to contact the greatest percentage of its clients?

Please check my file for a graph and some very simple EDA to make sure the dataset was balanced, and there were no outliers.
The data was clean, there wasn't a need to deal with nulls or etc...

Answer:
It looks like October gets 21.28% of all visitors (213/1001)
September gets the 2nd most with 12.09% of visitors (121/1001)
I'd present them with this data, so they can make the decision if to release in October for our largest month, or if we should release in September to try and capture our two largest months.
